Additionally, no idea was perfect on its own, and finding a mix between different aspects of different ideas was tough for me. It was fun to narrow everything down and start sketching out a final plan, but that also meant that I had to lose some of the creativity in the steps before, and focus on a more serious plan. In the future, I think I need to focus more on the idea that no solution will ever be perfect, and we figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t through trial and error.

For me, it was a perfect mix between creativity and technical skills, and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenges that came with making my own creations. While it was difficult to use a limited supply of resources, figuring out how to create what I wanted to do despite not having the materials I wanted was part of the fun. My solutions turned out much rougher than I first sketched, but I think that's the beauty in prototyping. Similar to the ideating stage, I wish I had known that no one solution could ever be perfect, but I quickly learned in the actual modeling that making rough prototypes wasn\u2019t as intensive of a process as I thought, and I could try a few concepts I liked. The process as a whole was great and really got my mind turning, and while my models aren\u2019t pretty, I have a lot of insight now when it comes to design thinking.
