It was challenging to find a middle ground between a need that was too large to tackle and a need that was too frivolous to be worthy of catering to. It was fun making the drawings, though, and the creative aspect was great. You don\u2019t often see the creative side of technical fields, so I really enjoyed the little artistic venture that came with this step. Knowing what I know now, I think finding needs that we can design solutions for will be more natural and easier in the future \\n\\n## Step 2: Defining\\n\\nThis step had the largest learning curve of any of the steps in my opinion. It was difficult initially to get the ball rolling and to think creatively, but after my first few ideas, everything started to just flow. I do plan on being a little more serious with the ideas in the future as I went a little overboard with the creativity, but all in all I think there was value in some of the joking responses. Thinking of solutions as a whole was a great time, and while difficult, I really did enjoy this step.\\n\\n![Idea Board](./IMG_5984.jpeg)\\nImage of my idea board\\n\\n\\n## Step 3: Ideating\\n\\nSorting through all of my own ideas as well as my classmates was the most difficult part of the process for me. There were so many great ideas, but a lot of them weren\u2019t feasible, or had too many complications. Additionally, no idea was perfect on its own, and finding a mix between different aspects of different ideas was tough for me. It was fun to narrow everything down and start sketching out a final plan, but that also meant that I had to lose some of the creativity in the steps before, and focus on a more serious plan. In the future, I think I need to focus more on the idea that no solution will ever be perfect, and we figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t through trial and error. I was so honed in on a one and done solution, but when it came to actual prototyping, I realized I had to try a few solutions before I found what I really liked. \\n\\n## Step 4: Prototyping\\n\\nI absolutely loved this step. For me, it was a perfect mix between creativity and technical skills, and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenges that came with making my own creations. While it was difficult to use a limited supply of resources, figuring out how to create what I wanted to do despite not having the materials I wanted was part of the fun. My solutions turned out much rougher than I first sketched, but I think that\'s the beauty in prototyping. Similar to the ideating stage, I wish I had known that no one solution could ever be perfect, but I quickly learned in the actual modeling that making rough prototypes wasn\u2019t as intensive of a process as I thought, and I could try a few concepts I liked. The process as a whole was great and really got my mind turning, and while my models aren\u2019t pretty, I have a lot of insight now when it comes to design thinking. \\n\\n![Prototype image](./IMG_6026.jpeg)\\n\\nImage of prototype - mother thought the ones I made in school were trash so I improvized with a box I had on hand"},{"id":"/Project-writeup","metadata":{"permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/Project-writeup","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/Project-writeup.md","source":"@site/blog/Project-writeup.md","title":"2022 Computer Science Research Write-Up","description":"Learn about my work in the 2022 Computer Science Research Class.","date":"2023-10-03T16:56:37.945Z","formattedDate":"October 3, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":1.25,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":1},"prevItem":{"title":"Design Thinking Reflection","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/prototyping/prototyping-writeup"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Learn about my work in the 2022 Computer Science Research Class.\\n\\n## Write-Up\\n\\nHi, my name is Ethan Saba and I\u2019m a Senior who took Honors Computer Science research in the 2022 school year. Over the course of the year, I worked on a website to make it easier for consumers to find the cheapest price of a product. With evergrowing product choices around the world, I thought there should be a hub where consumers could easily sort through listings and quickly find what retailer offers a product at the lowest price. To begin, I started researching different website structures that could most effectively achieve my goal. I settled on a structure called Ruby on Rails, which allowed me to get a website running quickly and easily. Ruby, the language used to code in Ruby on Rails, is simple to learn and read, which made it ideal for a project like this that had such a short time frame. I built on this by making the visual aspect of the website with a coding library called React. React was created by Facebook developers to simplify the creation of the visual portion of a website. Using React, I was able to make product cards and simple website navigation popups with the knowledge I already had, making it incredibly useful over the course of this project. While there is a lot of functionality I\u2019d like to have, I\u2019m very happy with my progress and I\u2019m grateful for the skills I have learned."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.405,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber"},{"name":"Yangshun Tay","title":"Front End Engineer @ Facebook","url":"https://github.com/yangshun","imageURL":"https://github.com/yangshun.png","key":"yangshun"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["slorber","yangshun"],"tags":["facebook","hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"2022 Computer Science Research Write-Up","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/Project-writeup"},"nextItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/mdx-blog-post"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/mdx-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["slorber"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/welcome"},"nextItem":{"title":"Long Blog Post","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/long-blog-post"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Long Blog Post","description":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,","date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.05,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Endilie Yacop Sucipto","title":"Maintainer of Docusaurus","url":"https://github.com/endiliey","imageURL":"https://github.com/endiliey.png","key":"endi"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"long-blog-post","title":"Long Blog Post","authors":"endi","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/mdx-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Blog Post","permalink":"/Saba-Website/blog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,\\n\\nUse a `\x3c!--` `truncate` `--\x3e` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
