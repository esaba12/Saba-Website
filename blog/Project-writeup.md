# 2022 Computer Science Research Write-Up

Learn about my work in the 2022 Computer Science Research Class.

## Write-Up

Hi, my name is Ethan Saba and I’m a Senior who took Honors Computer Science research in the 2022 school year. Over the course of the year, I worked on a website to make it easier for consumers to find the cheapest price of a product. With evergrowing product choices around the world, I thought there should be a hub where consumers could easily sort through listings and quickly find what retailer offers a product at the lowest price. To begin, I started researching different website structures that could most effectively achieve my goal. I settled on a structure called Ruby on Rails, which allowed me to get a website running quickly and easily. Ruby, the language used to code in Ruby on Rails, is simple to learn and read, which made it ideal for a project like this that had such a short time frame. I built on this by making the visual aspect of the website with a coding library called React. React was created by Facebook developers to simplify the creation of the visual portion of a website. Using React, I was able to make product cards and simple website navigation popups with the knowledge I already had, making it incredibly useful over the course of this project. While there is a lot of functionality I’d like to have, I’m very happy with my progress and I’m grateful for the skills I have learned.
