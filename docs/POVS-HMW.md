# POVs and How Might Wes 

## Background

A "Point of View" (POV) is a method of explaining a short biography of an interviewee is along with a need they have. It consists of a a short description of the interviewee and their background, followed by insight they provided regarding an issue they have in their life, ending with a rough idea of what can help solve said issue.

A "How Might We" (HMW) is the beginning of a response to the need identified in a POV. It begins with "How Might We", and continues on to explain a general concept of a solution for the need.

## Interviewee 1: Sam S

**POV:** I met Sam, a Persian textile manufacturer from Los Angeles who recently built a new home. I was amazed to realize that he installed a whole smart home system, but still finds it difficult to use simple features like watching tv and playing music in different zones simultaneously. It would be game-changing to make a system that better suited his needs and budget? 

**HMW:** How might we make learning as easy as 1,2,3. 

## Interviewee 2: Chloe S

**POV:** I met Chloe, a female Persian pre-med student at the University of Michigan. I found it interesting to realize that she felt uncomfortable working with home automation and specifically smart assistants because of privacy concerns she heard about in the news. It would be game-changing to make a more secure smart home system.

**HMW:** How might we build trust with our smart assistants?

## Interview 3: Kevin V

**POV:** I met with Kevin, a home security and networking installer in the Los Angeles area. I was amazed to learn how frustrated he was by people asking for cheap home automation systems, despite his belief that no good, cheap options exist in the space. It would be game changing to have more affordable home automation systems to expand his clientele. 

**HMW:** How might we make home automation feel like having a butler?
