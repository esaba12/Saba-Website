# Needfinding Interviews and Analysis 

## Interview 1: Shahrokh S

**Insights:**
* His biggest concern was home audio - Shahrokh loves music, and wanted speakers all over his house. This seems to be one of the biggest use cases of “smart home”.
* He got his audio system and home automation system professionally installed. It costed a pretty penny, and it's not very intuitive, which he hates.
* He has looked into automating lights and blinds in hard to reach places – areas he recommends I focus on.

**Insights:**
* Things are easy enough for people and there isn’t a demand for home automation in the houses he builds
* The idea of sensors to monitor a home is quite compelling, and as someone who sees leaks a lot, he loves this. He thinks ideas like this, that focus on enabling people to do things they can’t do otherwise rather than making daily tasks easier is the way to go
* Older people have no interest in learning new systems, they just like simplicity and minimal change
