# Project Plan: MVP and Proof of Concept

## What is your project idea?

My project idea is an AI based personal stylist. This stylist will take images of items in your closet or outfits you've worn, and store them to recommend new outfits with the same clothing articles. Down the line, it will be able to recommend new items to purchase. 

## What is your MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?

My MVP is an app that runs on apple devices that collects photos of your clothing and recommends outfits using the clothes inputted. The only functions required are a way to input your current clothes and an output of new outfits.

## Proof of Concept

The biggest challenge will be creating an Ai model that can recommend outfits. A basic way to circumvent the difficulties in this step is to use GPT4's photo input. This is flawed in that GPT is not dedicated to designing outfits so it may not be the best at creating good looking new outfits, but it is a good starting point.

**There is no visual aid because I do not have GPT4 yet**

## Nice to haves

In order, these are the "Nice to haves" I'd like to implement: 1. Recommendation of new items to purchase 2. Color matching based on skin tone 3. Marketplace to buy and sell clothes 4. Pintreest type social tab to see other's outfits with items similar to those you already own.
