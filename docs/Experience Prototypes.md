# Experience Prototypes 

## Background

A "How Might We" (HMW) is the beginning of a response to the need identified in a POV. It begins with "How Might We", and continues on to explain a general concept of a solution for the need.

An Experience Prototype is a physical demonstration of a solution presented in a HMW. They are interactive and tested with live users, and but generally extremely barebones. Because of this, they require assumptions to be made. 

## Prototype 1: Microphone Guard

**HMW:** How might we build trust with our smart assistants?

**Prototype Idea:** Smart assistant that can not possibly be always listening. 

**Actual Prototype:** A person putting a box over a smart speaker until its cue word is said.

  ### Experience 1: Sholeh S

  Sholeh is an accounting manager in Los Angeles. She doesn't allow for her Amazon echo to be plugged in for fear it is always listening. In the experience she liked the idea of a barrier from the smart device, but wasn’t comfortable with assuming that “box” was truly on her side. She explained that there would need to be very apparent physical indicators and proof that there are no microphones listening to her for her to feel truly comfortable.

  ### Experience 2: Nicole S

  Nicole is a college counselor in Los Angeles, California. Going into the experienced, her attitude can be summarized by the following statement she made: "Alexa is just sus." She distrusts all the companies that create smart assistants and fears her data is being stolen. In the experience, she expressed that she was lot more willing to own assistant with extra security, but feels like there should be an indicator somewhere to show when main mic is on.

## Prototype 2: Drag and Drop Assistant  

**HMW:** How might we make learning as easy as 1,2,3. 

**Prototype Idea:** Dumbed down version of complex home automation setup.  

**Actual Prototype:** A drag and drop style code interface for smart automation.

  ### Experience 1: Ariella M

  Ariella is a lawyer in Los Angeles. She is in the market for a home but does not have any outspoken interest in making her home "smart". Her thoughts on the experience were that getting the hang of the "drag and drop" system had a bit of a learning curve, but after a while it became fairly intuitive. She explained that on her own, she thinks that even this was not intuitive enough for her to easily figure out, being quoted saying: "IDK if I’d be down to watch a YouTube tutorial for this”. 

  ### Experience 2: Aaron M

  Aaron is a student at Harvard Westlake high school who has a passion for coding. He thought the entire process in this experience was super straightforward, and he would be a lot more willing to enter the smart home space "if it was always this simple."

## Prototype 3: Home Butler

**HMW:** How might we make home automation feel like having a butler?

**Prototype Idea:** Simple and human smart assistant.

**Actual Prototype:** A demonstration of the experience of having the “butler” wake you up. 

### Experience 1: Noah H

Noah is a student at Brentwood High School is Los Angeles. He is a huge fan of making his life easier. Before entering the experience, he said, “This thing better not be annoying", which is an indication that he has not enjoyed past use with smart assistants. Overall though, he enjoyed the ease of using the "Butler".

### Experience 2: Dijon J

Dijon is a personal trainer in Los Angeles. He likes the concept of automating usual habits, and explained how much he would love his blinds being opened for him. He did enjoy the experience, and said he hopes that assistants like Siri become this smart in the future.
